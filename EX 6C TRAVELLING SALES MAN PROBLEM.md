## Algorithm

1. Initialize a list of all cities except the starting city `s`.
2. Generate all possible permutations of the remaining cities.
3. For each permutation:

   * Set total path cost to 0.
   * Starting from city `s`, add the cost to the next city in the permutation.
   * After visiting all cities, return to the starting city and add that cost.
4. Track the **minimum** of all such path costs.
5. Return the minimum cost found.

## Program:
```
To implement the program for TSP.

def travellingSalesmanProblem(graph, s):
    ##Write your code
    vertex = [] 
    for i in range(V): 
        if i != s: 
            vertex.append(i) 
    min_path = maxsize 
    next_permutation=permutations(vertex)
    for i in next_permutation:

        current_pathweight = 0
        k = s 
        for j in i: 
            current_pathweight += graph[k][j] 
            k = j 
        current_pathweight += graph[k][s] 
        min_path = min(min_path, current_pathweight) 
         
    return min_path
   
 
 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = [[0, 10, 15, 20], [10, 0, 35, 25],
            [15, 35, 0, 30], [20, 25, 30, 0]]
    s = 0
    print(travellingSalesmanProblem(graph, s))
```

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding the minimum cost to vist all cities.
